# unnamed-harness Agent Router

This file is the stable entry point for AI-assisted work in this workspace. Markdown context is authoritative.

## First time in this workspace

This workspace uses routed Markdown context. Do not read every context file.

1. Start with this file and follow the ordered protocol below.
2. Read only the project index, shared guidance, policies, and focused route selected for the task.
3. Treat routed Markdown as authoritative. Ask when no project matches or when several matches would change the work.
4. Inspect a user-named source file before broad discovery.

## Project routing table

| Project | Workspace-relative path | Local index | Shared guidance |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| unnamed-harness | `.` | `.ai/README.md` | `.ai/projects/unnamed-harness.md` |

Held projects are intentionally absent from this active routing table; their scope and boundaries remain in shared guidance.

## Ordered protocol

1. Read `.ai/workspace.md`.
2. Match the requested path in the project routing table above. For a direct session, use the project containing the working directory.
3. Read **only** the selected project's local index. Choose a task route there and defer its focused documents until that route applies.
4. Read the selected project's shared guidance at the path shown above.
5. For coding, testing, configuration, documentation, or verification tasks, read `.ai/engineering-conventions.md`.
6. Read only task-applicable policies.
7. Execute the selected route in its exact order, including any named domain contract.
8. Inspect an exact user-named source file before broad discovery.

If no project matches, continue only for workspace-level work; do not guess a project. If multiple projects match and the choice changes the work, ask for clarification. Do not browse all of `.ai` or all local indexes.

## Boundaries

- Shared guidance defines cross-project contracts; local indexes define project-specific routes.
- Held projects are not active routes and must not be selected for ordinary work.
- Preserve unrelated changes and keep work within the selected project and requested paths.
